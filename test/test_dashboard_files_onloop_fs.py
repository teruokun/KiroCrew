"""Off-loop filesystem discipline for the dashboard file endpoints.

The blocking condition is not hypothetical. Every one of these endpoints takes
its path from the request, so which mount it lands on is the caller's choice,
not the gateway's. ``hooks.validate_file_path`` canonicalizes with
``os.path.realpath`` and (on Windows) walks the path's ancestors with one
``lstat`` each; ``os.path.isfile`` / ``isdir`` / ``open`` are the same class of
call. On an unresponsive mount -- a disconnected network share, a wedged FUSE
filesystem -- those syscalls block for however long the kernel takes and are
uninterruptible.

Run on the gateway's single event loop, ONE such request stalls every endpoint in
the process at once (dashboard, tunnel, MCP, crons), and a stall outlasting
``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs`` makes the loop watchdog kill the
gateway. AUTOSDE ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` covers exactly this shape.

Two guards, mirroring ``test_auto_research_onloop_fs.py``:

1. a static AST ratchet, so a new inline ``realpath`` / ``isfile`` / ``open`` in
   one of these ``async def`` bodies fails here rather than in production;
2. behavioural proof, on the thread the syscall ACTUALLY ran on, for each
   endpoint -- with a control per endpoint that its answer did not change;
3. isolation proof for the DEDICATED probe pool: probes run on it and not on the
   loop's default executor, a saturated pool refuses new probes with a coded 503
   instead of queueing them, and unrelated ``asyncio.to_thread`` work stays
   schedulable while every probe worker is wedged.
