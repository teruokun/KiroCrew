/**
 * Typed client for `GET /api/file-grep` — the Files rail's CONTENT search.
 *
 * Its own module rather than another method on `api/client.ts`: the rail is the
 * only caller, the response carries a shape (a hit, and a hit's location inside
 * a document) that other call sites have no use for, and `client.ts` is ~3.5k
 * lines whose module graph pulls in the query client, the artifact-write
 * bookkeeping and the error journal. Same reasoning that split `apiError.ts` out.
 *
 * The REQUEST still goes through the blessed transport rather than raw `fetch`.
 * That is what carries `X-Session-Key` and, decisively, what runs the
 * session-expiry pipeline: a 403 with `X-Auth-Required` after the dashboard
 * session lapses has to raise the auth banner, not read as "content search
 * failed". `j` also produces the {@link ApiError} a caller branches on by
 * `status` (403 refused root, 404 not a directory, 503 probe capacity) instead
 * of matching message text.
 *
 * Filename search is `api.fileSearch` in `client.ts` and stays there — it feeds
 * the @-mention picker as well as the rail.
