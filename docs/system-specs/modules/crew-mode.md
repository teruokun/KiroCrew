# Crews

A **crew** is a named entry in the config's `agents` map. It binds a kiro-cli
agent template plus a workspace, a memory store, a model and a reasoning effort,
and it carries free-text `triggers` that decide whether the orchestrator may
route work to it. The selection path is the `select_crew` MCP tool.

This spec used to own a second thing spelled *crew*: **Crew Mode**, the
`"crew"` chat-slot mode whose control plane (`crew_chat.py`) fanned one
session's topics out to sub-sessions. It is retired — see
[Retired: Crew Mode](#retired-crew-mode) — in favour of the Crew Members page
(`/members`, served by `dashboard/handlers/members.py` and `members.py` in the
table below), where each crew is a standing agent with its own thread.

A crew is not a *Remote Instance* (see [instances.md](instances.md)), and not
an Issue Radar *crew*, which is that app's own repository work crew
(see [issue-radar.md](issue-radar.md)).

## Components

Legacy topic respawn requires its original run identity or surviving legacy
run state. If pruning removed both, continuation refuses with a named memory
error and leaves the queued request retryable; the owner must start a new topic.
Missing history must never silently turn a private topic into Global memory.

## Owner-reviewed capability inheritance

`agent_capabilities.py` resolves one verified Parent and explicit per-item
`set`, `remove` and `inherit` intent. The owner-only GET, POST preview and PUT
routes at `/api/agents/{name}/capabilities` use schema version 1. Preview ends
in `/preview`; PUT requires its opaque preview token and the GET revision.
Unknown fields, null sets, stale sources and ambiguous names are refused.

Enrollment is explicit. Shared members follow their selected Parent; a legacy
private snapshot starts with every existing row local and every absent Parent
row removed. Restoring one row leaves all other overrides intact. MCP transport
replacement is whole-value; autoApprove is separate. Skills preserve manual
resources and cannot change tool or approval lists. An exclusion still covered
by a wildcard or another approval list is refused instead of claimed effective.
Ordinary upstream changes reconcile through the same resolver. New capabilities,
transport changes and broader approvals stay pending owner acceptance. Local
conflicts retain their usable values: accepting a Parent row moves only the
accepted Parent baseline, an explicit local override on that row keeps applying
on top of it, and an `inherit` or restore on that row adopts the current
Parent value and advances that row's accepted baseline. Selected Parent rows can be accepted for
several already-enrolled members of the same exact Parent in one request. The
editor offers those members as a checklist drawn from the declared crew roster
(the current member excluded); the backend alone decides eligibility and
answers `member_parent_mismatch` for a member outside this exact Parent. The
checklist hint says only that the names are declared members and that
eligibility is verified at review; it never calls a listed member eligible. The
pane's mode badge names the persisted following mode without a `Saved:` prefix;
the separate Saved/"Unsaved draft" badge reports draft state, using the same
"draft" word as the footer, its confirmation and the stale notice. Ticking
Follow changes the draft, not that persisted mode badge. One muted legend above
the row list, rendered once rather than per row, defines the source select's
three states: Inherited follows the parent's accepted value, Override sets this
member's own value, Removed drops it for this member. A shared-reference row
says it references a shared skill or resource with no private copy; it promises
no propagation to running members. The locked Agent Template pane's navigation
button reads "Edit in Capabilities"; the pane title stays "Capabilities".
The preview lists every member the reviewed request covers, the current
member first, and states "no effective value changes" when the effective values
are unchanged, without implying that inheritance metadata is unchanged. Each
Parent checkbox names its save-time action from the draft's actual Source first,
then the saved row state: Override dismisses the update while keeping the override;
Removed dismisses it while keeping the row removed; Inherited takes the Parent
value or removal. An explicit `inherit` draft already takes the current Parent
and advances its accepted baseline even unchecked, so its checkbox only selects
that update for the chosen peers; a nearby accessible hint separates the current
member's save outcome from the checkbox's peer-only effect in two short lines.
Action labels lead with what is kept or taken.
This replaces the generic acceptance label and duplicated selection/outcome prose.
Parent change-kind badges say "Parent added/removed/changed this", separately from
the impact list's Added/Removed/Changed labels and the conflict badge. The shared
and legacy modes both say "Not following parent", with an independent-legacy-
snapshot qualifier for the latter. The visible `local` state label is
Override; its API value remains `local`. The receipt then
names each kept row under the current member, derived only from the reviewed
selection, the server view's conflict flag and the sanitized preview projection
(a row still `local` and present, or still `removed` and absent, with no impact
entry), and shows Override or Stays removed beside its reference; it
never prints a value, never reads the raw draft, and never invents kept-row
details for a peer member, whose rows the response does not project. An
Inherited row that follows a Parent removal is never labelled as a kept local
choice; it is an impact entry when its effective presence changes.
The Follow checkbox places the unchanged-until-save and value/empty-field
preservation guarantee beside the control; one state-carrying helper explains
checked means overrides are editable and unchecked means read-only, replacing
the duplicate enrollment callout. Both are accessible descriptions while the
checkbox's accessible name stays stable. The label explicitly targets the native
checkbox id, so clicking its text toggles enrollment. Conflict and receipt prose wraps at
word boundaries; long code references can break anywhere. The transport option
is "Command (local process)"; the conflict badge says "Conflicts with your
override", distinct from the Override row state. Reload retrieves the server view
without moving the draft's revision; "Use the new version for this draft" moves
that revision and invalidates a prior preview, but does not review or save.
Review and atomic save remain separate steps. Receipt counts use registered
locale-specific plural forms. The approval helper states that
making a tool available does not auto-approve it. A short live helper under the
list selector states where the selected list is stored and which references it
matches; the select and section labels stay short. Empty approval
section headings are hidden, but their selector choices and draft additions
remain available. Hidden transport leaves keep short placeholders; a separate
hint explains that typing changes only the draft, saved hidden values remain
until a replacement is saved, and discarding keeps the original. The footer's
Discard draft opens a nested, always-mounted Radix confirmation rather than
immediately clearing the draft. Cancelling keeps edits and the signed preview;
confirming clears the draft and preview without closing the editor or calling
the server. The editor's separate close guard states in its title that it closes
the editor, names the member whose edits are unsaved, and says no other member
is affected, since one editor holds one draft.

Each owner save writes new private spec identities and switches all selected
bindings through one config-delta publication. This includes changes to accepted
Parent baselines or local intent whose effective values stay unchanged; only a
save with unchanged spec and intent keeps its generation. Failed spec or config
publication keeps the prior bindings, specs, accepted baselines and local choices;
old generations may be marked pending, but staged choices remain private on new
generations. Reconciliation can clear that pending marker without accepting the
failed batch; the owner can review and retry the same selection. After binding
publication, a failed final receipt leaves all selected new generations pending;
reconciliation verifies them without minting replacements. Preview
values redact credential containers. The existing governance sanitizer still
runs at publication. Withheld shortcuts become tombstones, so a later policy
relaxation does not resurrect them automatically.

`prepare_member_capabilities(member, project_dir)` verifies the saved spec and
Parent identity without claiming that a provider loaded it. API runtime state
remains pending or unverified until runtime integration supplies observations.
The existing fork refresh delegates enrolled definitions to this resolver.
Legacy PATCH and direct rebind refuse an enrolled definition rather than
bypassing its intent. Unreadable authoritative state returns bounded
`503 capabilities_unavailable`; the final PATCH guard runs under the spec lock
before bookkeeping. A late legacy publish rebind refusal retains the old binding
and rolls back its staged destination, not a claim that no writes occurred.
Runtime views are projected from allocation-owned state through the public
`SessionManager.capability_runtime_view` facade; response rows expose no mutable
registry dictionaries. The existing whole-reset button explicitly restores the
verified current Parent through the capability transaction. Publish flattens
only the saved valid snapshot, without accepting pending Parent expansions or
exporting inheritance metadata. Publish records its member, source and target
snapshot identities in the existing sidecar before creating the destination or
committing the binding. The destination stays private until a second
config-first transaction verifies its binding, ownership, bytes and current
governance and clears only the temporary lineage. A failed final write returns
the committed template with `warning: publish_incomplete`, matching legacy
publish behavior. Retrying the same name completes that transition, including
after restart or a lost response; changed source/target bytes, a newer binding
or foreign ownership refuse without overwriting anything. Completed receipts
remain for idempotent retries and never enter the shared agent JSON.

Native permission policies that exactly match
the existing allowedTools derivation follow owner approval edits. Custom
permission policies and alternate toolsSettings shortcuts require a separate
review and are refused rather than silently bypassed. Cleanup of superseded
private generations is not implemented by this backend checkpoint, and no
generation is deleted today. A future cleanup must retain every generation that
a member binding names, that a live session's `LoadedCapabilities` stamp names,
that a `CapabilityPreparation` returned by `prepare_runtime` still references
between preparation and the loaded stamp, that a persisted resume record could
lead back to, or that a retained publish receipt names as source or target.
Because a preparation exists before any stamp and holds no registry entry, the
three visible references (binding, stamp, receipt) do not prove a generation
unreferenced. Deletion therefore requires a shared lock or explicit allocation
lease taken by the reconciliation seam that mints generations, plus an audit of
persisted resume references, and it fails closed: a generation whose absence of
references cannot be proven is kept. Binding
updates preserve config.local member overrides and write a narrow delta in the
active layer under base-then-overlay locks. A batch spanning both layers uses
one atomic overlay delta. Enrollment preserves absent fields, null prompt/model
values, custom hooks/settings and the original includeMcpJson choice. Removing
capabilities while provider-global MCP inclusion remains enabled is refused as
unrepresentable; enrollment alone never silently disables that existing source.

Parent selection reuses `agent_spec_path` with an explicit scope directory.
Unrelated malformed files are skipped; duplicate names, a broken exact-name
project claim and a changed pinned source still refuse resolution. Safe response
projection retains arrays and maps and masks credential values. URL userinfo
is masked from parsed username or password on every scheme, without relying on
the shared redactor's known-scheme patterns; revision-bound URL retention still
preserves the exact original bytes. Complete sensitive
`NAME=VALUE` argument assignments are recognized on both sides of `--`; that
terminator stops option inference, not assignment scanning. Retention preserves
the entire original argument, including additional equals signs in its value. The
`agent_capabilities.py` response boundary is registered in the security posture
redaction inventory, so the omission gate checks it with the other outputs. MCP `set`
accepts `retain_paths`, RFC6901 pointers into the complete replacement value.
Each pointer must address exactly `[REDACTED]` and the same redacted scalar leaf
in the current member transport. Empty/root, malformed, overlapping, duplicate
and out-of-range pointers refuse the whole request; any unretained placeholder
also refuses. Omitted fields are removed, not deep-merged. Retained bytes stay
server-side and are covered by preview/revision checks. MCP rows carry an
explicit `managed` flag; absent prompt/model rows remain editable. Rows do not
carry constant `editable` or redundant `locked_reason` fields: managed transport
fields stay read-only while Source and Enabled remain available. Runtime status
is one of pending, unverified, applied or failed; the separate Saved configuration
badge describes persisted configuration, not provider application.

Owned Parents retain the existing dynamic command, hooks and data-home refresh.
That pass cannot add omitted servers or tools and preserves local prompt/model
and resource choices. App namespace transports require a current enabled app's
exact declaration and use its authoritative transport. Safe ordinary Parent
fields (description, welcomeMessage and keyboardShortcut) follow updates; legacy
snapshots retain their explicit local baseline for these fields.

Reconciliation publishes changed bytes under a new private name and atomically
switches the member binding, leaving the old runtime's file unchanged. A no-op
keeps its generation. Failed writes retain pending intent; retry completes it
without modifying an earlier generation. Already-published pending receipts can
finish without another generation. Public revisions are random version ids;
source-content digests remain internal. The prepare seam refuses pending work
and never reports provider application from a successful save. Enrollment
intent lives in the shared `agent_model_state.json`, so an unreadable sidecar
cannot prove any declared member unenrolled: `prepare_runtime` refuses every
crew-member cold start with the closed code `capability_state_unreadable` (the
capabilities API answers `503 capabilities_unavailable`) rather than inferring
legacy mode, and a session that resolves to no crew never reads the sidecar.
An explicit `crew_agent` claim naming no `config.agents` entry refuses with
`capability_member_missing`; an implicit name outside the crew namespace
resolves to no crew and is unaffected.

## Crew records and binding

A crew lives only in `config.json` under `agents.<name>`. It is not a kiro-cli
agent file: `kiro_agent` points at one. `resolve_agent_bindings` turns a crew
name into `ResolvedBindings`, in this order:

1. the named crew, when it is a key of `config.agents`;
2. otherwise a **materialized** kiro agent of that name (an app-registered agent
   under the user's `~/.kiro/agents/`, or a project agent), which keeps
   dispatching itself with the default workspace and Global Memory V1;
3. otherwise `default_agent`, with `requested_resolved` set to `False` so a
   caller never advertises a binding that is not running.

An unresolvable workspace falls back to `default_workspace`. Memory identity
resolves exactly: the reserved `default` assistant uses Global Memory V1;
existing members keep their declared V1 binding until the owner chooses V2.
New and opted-in members own unique private V2 stores. Missing, unreadable,
shared or mismatched private identity stops execution with an actionable error.
Selecting a member as `default_agent` preserves that member's memory version and
binding. With no agents configured, the resolver returns the existing defaults.

Member creation automatically provisions empty private memory. Members cannot
choose a shared store or rebind their private store. Legacy members may continue
using V1 or explicitly choose empty V2 memory from their settings; former Global
or named V1 contents remain untouched. Config fields, atomic publication, ownership manifest and
recovery semantics are owned by [config](config.md#named-memory-stores-memory_storespy).

A new member DM inherits the member's configured workspace, falling back to
`default_workspace` when that name is undeclared. Its project directory uses the
shared `default_project_dir` validation, so provider cwd and project essentials
refer to the same workspace. Resolution finishes before publishing the slot;
the first slot broadcast includes its project directory. A concurrent opener's
existing slot is preserved. Reopening a live or restored
thread keeps its saved workspace and project, including an explicitly empty
project, rather than resetting a session choice to the member default.

Opting into V2 opens a fresh member conversation. Existing V1 conversation and
native provider context cannot become private context by changing the config.
The member-thread binding records its private store generation and reuses that
conversation across later opens and restarts. An already protected V2 thread
keeps its existing key. Old schedules and child runs retain their recorded store;
the opt-in does not relabel past or already assigned work.

Private memory also pins an active dashboard turn to its member in ordinary
chat slots. A provider-side agent switch stops the stream with a visible notice
and resets the provider before another turn; later events cannot continue under
another agent while using that member's memory. This covers member DMs and
ordinary V2 chats. Ordinary V1 chats keep their existing switch behavior. The
validation and reset contract is owned by
[session](session.md#private-member-session-ownership).

The member side panel's Crew summary tab and the editor link to
`/settings/overview?view=memory&store=<name>`. The private memory workspace has
Memories, Profile and Recovery tabs: browsing/search/correction/copy stay in
Memories, preferences and project anchors stay in Profile, and backups plus
retired experiences stay in Recovery. Advanced facet analysis is collapsed.
Profile and Recovery load on first visit; visited Profile stays mounted so tab
changes cannot discard its drafts. Changing the selected member requires explicit
discard while a profile draft or memory mutation dialog is open. Source references
are rendered as origin labels and item references rather than JSON payloads.

The workspace header, store picker and copy-source picker reuse the owning
member's exact avatar descriptor and name, including uploaded pictures. Returning
from the member editor refreshes that identity. Empty memory can open
`/members?member=<exact-name>` directly; this link selects the member by name,
then uses the existing verified thread-opening endpoint. A failed thread open
retains its localized error heading and structured diagnostic report. Details
reveals the redacted reason on demand; Ask the agent receives the same report
when navigation permits. The cached conversation and its drafts remain available.

Facts, rules and experiences all support correction and explicit forgetting.
Experience correction keeps the same record identity and provenance. A store
marked unavailable still makes a scoped read to obtain its actual refusal, with
Retry and Recovery actions; it never displays cached records as a successful
read. Recovery paginates retired memories and refreshes live recall after an
item is restored. Complete snapshot restoration stays visibly staged across
page visits until gateway restart, and the owner can cancel the pending stage
without changing current memory or its saved backup.

Inline schedules created inside the editor persist `member_id` separately from
the provider template. A legacy schedule carrying only `agent_id` stays in Global
Memory V1 even when that string matches a member alias. The editor lists private
member jobs by exact `member_id`, and an existing job's member is immutable.
Legacy jobs retain their previous template/sequence display attribution and show
Global Memory V1 in the member's Schedules pane. Displaying an old schedule there
does not migrate it or grant access to that member's private store.

`resolve_effective_model` is the single source of truth for what model a new
session on a crew starts with, highest tier first: the crew's own `model`, the
bound kiro agent's pinned model (skipped for the built-in `kirocrew` agent), the
global `agent.model`, then the installed agent file's model. A per-session pick
outranks all four and is not considered there.

The loader is defensive about hand-edited config: a non-string `model` or
`triggers` collapses to `""`, an unknown `reasoning_effort` collapses to inherit,
and a junk watchdog override collapses to `0`.

## Hire: `POST /api/members` (copy-on-hire)

A crew member is a Kiro custom agent plus the wrapper row; **hire** is the one
verb that makes a member from a definition. Source kind `local` adopts an
installed agent file (`~/.kiro/agents/<agent>.json`):

```json
{"source": {"kind": "local", "agent": "reviewer"},
 "display_name": "Checkout triage", "role": "Oncall Triage Engineer",
 "workspace": "default", "triggers": "", "session_color": ""}
```

`source.kind` must be a string in `_HIRE_SOURCE_KINDS` -- `local` or `store` (an
unhashable value is a 400 `unsupported_source_kind`, never a `TypeError`);
`source.agent` must be in the template-name grammar (`invalid_source_agent`) -- the
source is a FILE the installed listing offers, dots included (`reviewer.v2`), and the
row is bound to the copy, whose stem the copy writer mints from the member id, so the
binding stays inside the agent-name grammar; the optional text fields (`workspace`,
`description`, `triggers`, `session_color`) must be strings when present (400
`invalid_<field>`, before anything is written -- the create core stores them as given,
and a list there is a member that persists and then raises when its thread opens or
`route_crew` reads it).
A display name whose minted id would share another member's SLUG is 409
`slug_collision` before anything is written (`_slug_collision_refusal`, the create's
`admit` hook: it runs INSIDE the config-lock hold against the snapshot the row is
published from, with the id the create minted, and AGAIN inside
`persist_member_config`'s cross-process locked mutation against the document's
`agents` map as it is on disk at the write (`MemberAdmissionRefused` carries the
hook's own code back; nothing is written) -- the in-process lock does not hold a
second gateway or the CLI, and two processes' pre-lock checks could both pass for
`Triage` and `triage` and then serialize into two rows on one slug): the slug keys
`members/<slug>/`, the rules file and the DM binding, and it is lossy (`Foo` and
`foo` share one), so two members on it would inherit each other's briefing and be
refused their thread and rules as a collision -- the hire is where that is still
sayable.
Source kind **`store`** hires from a template an installed app offers in its
manifest's `crew.templates` (`app-kit-platform.md` 3.1): `source: {kind: "store",
app, agent}` where `agent` is the manifest `agents` path the card names. The whole
store hire runs under the app's lifecycle lock (`apps.manager.app_lifecycle_lock`,
the one install/update/uninstall take): an update of the app between resolving the
listing and copying its materialized agent would copy the new bytes while recording
the old version and spec as the member's pristine BASE. Inside it,
`member_templates.resolve_store_template` resolves the listing BEFORE anything is
written: the app must be installed (404 `app_not_installed`) and enabled (409
`app_disabled` -- only an enabled app has its agents materialized), the app must
pass **admission again** against the manifest on disk now (409
`app_admission_denied`: install, update and enable each ran it, but the card's
role, triggers and briefing become prompt-adjacent text on the member and the
manifest they come from is the app's to rewrite after enable -- a signed manifest
edited afterwards no longer carries a valid signature; builtins are exempt exactly
as enable exempts them), the manifest
must carry a card for that agent (404 `template_not_offered`), the `crew` section
must still validate against the tree as it is NOW -- the same checks install ran,
against the same root, plus canonical containment of the card's `agent` and
`initial_briefing` paths (409 `template_invalid`; the manifest install validated is
not the manifest on disk after the app rewrote it), the card's **content digests**
must hold (`_verify_card_content`: a declared `digests.agent` / `digests.initial_briefing`
is checked against the bytes on disk NOW through `pinned_fs.read_bytes_pinned` -- a
mismatch is 409 `template_tampered`, nothing written -- and a fleet whose admission
policy `require_signature`s refuses a card that does not pin EVERY file it points at
(the agent, and the briefing when one is named), 409 `template_unverified`: the
signature covers the card, and only the card's digests carry it to the agent file and
the briefing, so for that fleet a signed posting with an unpinned file is not the
verification it asks for; an open fleet hires an undigested card as before), the
shipped spec must read (409 `template_spec_unreadable`), the materialized
`<app>--<agent name>` file must exist (409 `template_not_materialized`) and, for a
pinned card or a signature fleet, must be EXACTLY the bridge's rendering of the
verified shipped definition now (`_verify_materialized_matches` against
`bridges.render_app_agent_spec(keep_user_edits=False)` -- own servers, managed refs,
the per-app MCP policy and prompt, compared as parsed JSON; 409 `template_tampered`
otherwise): the digests speak for the shipped bytes, but the hire COPIES the
materialized file, which lives in the agent-writable agents directory, so a hand
edit to a pinned app's shared template or an agent's rewrite of it is refused
rather than copied as the publisher's (customize the member's own copy instead).
**Shared template files are read-only to members** and carry a **recorded
fingerprint**: the materialized `<app>--<agent>` file (a builtin app's included)
sits in the kiro agents tree, which the agent file-edit gate refuses to write and
the OS sandbox seals read-only as a directory (`sandbox._resolved_kiro_agents_targets`),
so a member's tools cannot rewrite the definition its siblings are still hired
from; and when the bridge materializes the file it records `sha256:<hex>` of the
bytes it wrote in the agent-state sidecar (`agent_state.set_shared_template_digest`,
itself sealed), every trusted rewrite of that file re-records it
(`agent._atomic_json_write`, the funnel the editor's PATCH, a model reset and the
spec migration all use -- file and record as ONE transaction: the record is read
strictly before a byte lands (an unreadable sidecar refuses the write), and when the
record cannot be written after the replace the previous bytes are put back, so what
is on disk still matches the recorded digest and the template stays spawnable while
the caller sees its edit fail; only a rollback that itself fails leaves the two apart,
and that is logged -- pinned: `test_a_rewrite_whose_record_cannot_follow_is_rolled_back`),
deregistration forgets it, and the KAS projection
(`acp/kas_agents.load_agent_spec`) refuses to inject a fingerprinted file whose
bytes no longer match -- log + security event `shared_template_fingerprint_mismatch`,
fail closed with the repair named (re-enable the app or restart the gateway to
re-materialize), and an unreadable record is a refusal too; a file no bridge
materialized (a hand-written spec, a member's own copy) has no record and loads as
before. Pinned in `test/test_app_bridges.py::TestSharedTemplateFingerprint`,
`test/test_kas_agents.py::TestRecordedFingerprint` and the store hire's
`test_shared_template_files_are_read_only_to_member_agents`.
Everything works from ONE snapshot: `_verify_card_content` returns the verified bytes
and the shipped spec and the briefing are parsed from them (never a second read of
the path); the render check starts from those same bytes (`render_app_agent_spec(
shipped_text=)`, a pure `_render_shipped_text` shared with registration); the
materialized file is read once into `StoreTemplate.materialized_spec` and the create
copies THAT dict (`_create_crew(copy_spec=)` → `_write_private_copy(source_spec=)`)
rather than re-reading the source -- a file swapped between the checks and the copy is
not what gets hired. The shipped spec and the initial briefing
are read through `pinned_fs.read_file_pinned` (ancestors pinned, a non-regular
final component refused): the app's tree is the app's to change after install, and
a by-name read there is a disclosure primitive pointed at whatever the name
resolves to. The materialized name becomes the `agent` the local steps below run
against, and the card's `role` and `triggers` fill the create body where the caller
sent NO such key (the card is the default; the caller's word wins, and an explicit
empty string is a word -- "no triggers" -- not an absence). The route
composes the create core, owner-gated once at the top, and is **atomic** -- the
member either exists with its own copy of the source or does not exist -- and **at
no moment is a row bound to the SHARED source readable**: the copy is made inside
the create's config-lock hold, before the row exists, and the row is published
already bound to it. The other order (publish, then fork and rebind) left a
source-bound row on disk between the two; a concurrent thread open in that gap
resolves the source binding and runs a session that keeps using the shared template
after the hire completed, which is the exact hazard the copy exists to remove.
Steps 2 onward run as ONE transaction under `chat_utils.drained` (the coroutine
twin of `drained_to_thread`): a cancellation of the request mid-way -- a gateway
shutdown, a client that closed the connection -- is absorbed until the transaction
reaches its own end (success or roll-back) and re-raised afterwards, so a copy is
never left without its row and a linked member never without its link:

| Step | Core | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| 1. resolve the source | `_load_template_specs` | 404 `template_not_found` / 409 `ambiguous_template_name`; nothing written. The create path tolerates a missing template (a crew may be bound ahead of an install); a hire may not, because its promise is a copy of that file |
| 2. copy-on-hire | inside `_create_crew(copy_source=…)`, after the id is minted, the slug admitted and the source has passed the foreign-private-copy check, under the config FILE lock (`update_config_locked` with a read-only mutate, the cross-process one the fork and publish paths hold for the same reason: a writer in another process cannot bind the destination between the bindings read and the file's first byte) and, inside it, the spec lock: `_write_private_copy` (the one writer of a private copy, shared with the editor's first-edit fork) copies the source into a member-owned file whose stem derives from the member id, re-reading the source in-lock, reserving every current binding and the boot-rebuilt stems, suffixing past collisions and reserved basenames, and records lineage in the `agent_state` sidecar in the same hold | 404 `template_not_found` (the source vanished between 1 and 2), 409 `ambiguous_template_name`, 500 `bookkeeping_failed` / `fork_failed`; nothing published |
| 3. publish the wrapper row | the rest of `_create_crew` (the body of `POST /api/agents`: private memory provisioned, the row persisted) with `kiro_agent` = the copy. The publication's `admit` hook (`_admit_doc`, every create -- plain and hire) re-runs the LINEAGE check inside `persist_member_config`'s cross-process locked mutation, against the sidecar and the document as they are at the write: the pre-lock check holds only the in-process lock, so a hire in another gateway can copy a template to exactly the name a plain create validated as "missing, tolerated" and record its member as the owner in between, and a row published anyway would bind a second member to one private definition; a foreign owner is 409 `foreign_private_copy`, an unreadable sidecar 409 `lineage_unverifiable`, and a row another process already bound to the private copy this member is about to bind is 409 `foreign_private_copy` as well (the sidecar names one owner; a row is the other half of the same fact). Pinned: `test_a_copy_recorded_between_the_lineage_check_and_the_write_is_refused`, `test_a_row_another_process_bound_to_the_copy_refuses_the_hire`. Then, outside the lock, the fork governance refresh (`_refresh_forked_templates`) re-runs exactly as the fork endpoint runs it after its rebind, so a pass that interleaved between the copy's lineage record and the row's persist -- and recorded the copy as an uncorroborated fork -- cannot leave the new member blocked at the spawn gate | its own 4xx/409, verbatim -- and the copy is **unwound** (`_unwind_private_copy`: file and lineage, unless a row already took the name -- reference check and unlink one critical section under the config lock, so a binder in another process cannot land between them), so a retry does not find a stranded file claiming the id |

A store hire has a **step 4**, inside the same atom and under the config lock the
create just released -- and the CROSS-PROCESS config file lock is held across the
guarded row update AND both file publications (`update_config_locked(after_write=)`:
the files are written after the row's rename landed, inside the same hold), so
every locked writer in any process (a delete, a rebind, a same-id recreate by a
second gateway) waits and the row the guard checked is the row the files are
published for -- the files are slug-keyed and the slug is lossy, so published
outside the hold a replacement member would receive this hire's base and briefing
as its own; a rename that fails writes neither file and the hire rolls back:
`_link_member_to_template`
records `template` (`<app>/<agent name>`) and `template_version` (the app's
manifest version) on the row in a locked read-modify-write that requires the row
to still carry this hire's generation and copy, writes the **pristine copy**
`<data home>/member-templates/<member id>.json` (`member_templates.write_pristine_copy`:
the agent definition as MATERIALIZED -- the `<app>--<agent>` file the hire copies,
the app bridge's own servers and managed refs included -- plus the card's
`role`/`triggers` at that version, stamped with the member id and the private-store
generation -- the BASE a later role update three-way merges against; written
through `update_config_locked(after_write=)`, i.e. AFTER the row's rename landed and
INSIDE the same lock hold, so a rename that fails leaves no base claiming a
provenance no row got and a same-id fire + rehire cannot slip between the row and
its base; keyed by the immutable id in a gateway-only TOP-LEVEL leaf of the data
home -- on `sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES` (bind-masked from every sandboxed process;
`trust/`, where it once lived, is sandbox-VISIBLE because the SEL key and log have
in-sandbox readers, so a spawned interpreter's `open()` could rewrite a base there
past the file-tool gate), on `_CREW_PRECREATE_HIDDEN_DIR_LEAVES` (materialized
owner-only before each spawn, since the root is otherwise built by the first store
hire and the mask loop is guarded on `isdir`) and on `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`
(the agent file tools refuse it on every OS); NOT in `members/<slug>/`: that
directory is agent-writable and its slug is lossy, so a BASE kept there could be
forged by an agent or shared by two members, and a forged or shared BASE makes the
merge skip a template change or overwrite a customization silently; published
through `pinned_fs.write_file_pinned`), and writes `members/<slug>/briefing.md` from the card's
`initial_briefing` (`seed_briefing`: the member did not exist until this locked
publication and no row held its slug -- the slug admission refuses a collision -- so
nothing at that name is the member's lived state: the member directory is
agent-writable and the slug a deterministic derivation of the display name, and a
file or link planted there ahead of the hire would otherwise become the new member's
`[CURRENT ASSIGNMENT]`; a pre-existing regular file or link is removed by its literal
name relative to the pinned directory (a link as a link, its target untouched),
recorded in the security event log (`member_briefing_preexisting_replaced`), and
the template's briefing is created in its place through an exclusive
`O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW` create -- never a follow, never a truncation of a
target; any other kind of entry, or a name taken again after the removal, fails the
hire closed; every byte is written and a write that fails midway removes the file;
a platform where briefings are not read gets none; from the hire on the file is the
member's lived state and no template operation touches it -- pinned:
`test_a_briefing_planted_before_the_hire_is_replaced_not_adopted`,
`test_a_store_hire_replaces_a_briefing_planted_at_its_slug`). A failure rolls the hire back (`_roll_back_hire`: the delete
route's own mutation through `_delete_crew_record` -- row removed, a private V2
store archived under the retirement marker, cached handles released -- but ONLY
while the row is still the one this hire made, bound to its copy and carrying the
private store name the create minted -- checked on the parsed config under the
in-process lock and AGAIN inside the delete's cross-process locked read-modify-write
(`_delete_crew_record(expect=)`, against the document on disk at the write), since a
writer in another process is not held by the in-process lock and a row it replaced
in the gap is not this hire's to delete; then the copy itself through
`_remove_private_copy`, inside one cross-process locked read-only mutation of the
config -- the "no row is bound to the copy" check reads the document under that lock
and the unlink happens in the same hold, so a same-id recreate in another process
(which publishes under the same lock) is either seen or waits, and its agent file is
never deleted under it -- only while the sidecar still names this member as the
copy's owner) and answers 500 `template_link_failed` with
`rolled_back: true`; a roll-back that is refused or fails answers 500
`hire_incomplete` naming the member `id`.

The create body is this package's own contract (pinned by its tests); the hire
reads it strictly -- a missing `name`, `kiro_agent`, `memory_store` or
`display_name` is a 500 `hire_incomplete`, never a guessed default. The answer
carries `kiro_agent` (the copy's name) beside the id for exactly this reader.
Why a server verb rather than the two client-reachable calls: a client that dies
between create and fork leaves a member bound to the SHARED source it was told
it owns -- the exact hazard copy-on-hire removes -- and only the server can roll
the first half back. Two members hired from one file therefore coexist, each with
its own copy and row; a second hire whose display name mints a taken id is a 409
`agent_exists` (the message names the typed name and the id).

Success: `{"ok": true, "id"}` -- the minted id (what `/members?member=` resolves);
the copy the member is bound to and what the caller sent (label, role, source) are
read back from the roster row, not echoed. The `GET /api/members` row carries `template` and
`template_version` (store provenance, `""` for a hand-made or locally adopted
member; the drawer's Source row reads `Template <app>/<agent> (v<version>)`) and
`template_origin` -- the template a member's own
copy was made from (`forked_from` where the sidecar's `private_to` is this
member), `""` when bound to a shared template directly -- so the drawer reads
`reviewer — customized copy` (the editor's own word for a forked copy is
"Customized") rather than presenting the copy's stem as a template. It passes the
same redactor as the other identity fields: a declared template name is text a
package or a hand-edited spec wrote. The lookup keys the sidecar by the row's
binding, itself free text in a hand-editable config: a non-string binding
(`kiro_agent: []`) lists with no lineage rather than turning the roster read into a
500 (pinned: `test_a_hand_edited_non_string_binding_lists_with_no_lineage`).

**Zero-config.** Only `source` is required. Without a `display_name` (absent or
blank) the member is named after its `role`, else after the source file, and the
row records **`named_by_user: false`** (`KiroCrewAgentConfig.named_by_user`,
default `true` -- every pre-existing row, every create with a typed name, and a
hire that took one are "named"; a hand-edited junk value reads as `true` so a
stray edit can never resurrect the hint). The create honours the flag: a defaulted
name is allowed to collide -- the id is suffixed the way the migration suffixes
(`code-reviewer-2`) and the label follows (`Code Reviewer #2`) -- because there is
no user to hand a 409 to; a typed name that collides is still 409 `agent_exists`.
The first rename (`PUT /api/agents/{id}` with `display_name`) flips the flag to
`true`; a PUT that leaves the name alone does not -- and neither does a save that
**echoes** the current name back (the Crew Manager form sends every field): the
flag flips only when the *effective* display name actually changes. `GET /api/members` carries
`named_by_user` (withheld from `GET /api/agents`, like `starred`), which is what
the thread header reads for its *Just hired · named after its role* hint and its
in-place rename (design step 6). This step ships the verb **API-only**: the UI's
one hire entry point is the **hire gallery** under the Crew Members page (step 6,
`/members/hire`), which lands with that step -- it lists every enabled installed
app's cards (`crew.templates`, with the card's duty, tags, category, starter prompts
and ghost face) beside the built-in and local agent files, and a card's hire sends
`source: {kind: "store", app, agent}`; until then the page's Add member is the crew
manager's plain create form, and the crew manager's own **New crew** stays a plain
create (bind to a shared template) either way. The drawer's Source row for a store-hired
member reads `Template triage from Oncall pack (v1.2.0)` -- the app by its display
name, from the installed-apps listing read only while a template-hired member is
open; the app id is the fallback when the app is gone, and a FAILED read is said
under the row (`ErrorNotice` with the agent hand-off; the row still shows the id)
rather than passed off as the app having no display name. Pinned in `test/test_member_hire.py`
(the gates: two members from one file coexist; one store template hired twice
coexist, each with the card's defaults, provenance, pristine copy and seeded
briefing; the card's ghost face is the member's face and the hire body cannot pass
one; **zero-config**: a hire with only a
source and a role lands `Code Reviewer` / `named_by_user: false`, a second one
`Code-Reviewer-2` / `Code Reviewer #2`, a typed name is marked named, a hire with
no role is named after the file, a blank name is an absence, the first rename
flips the flag and an untouched-name or echoed-name PUT does not, a typed collision is still 409;
no moment exists where a row is bound to the shared source -- the copy exists
before the row, the row persists bound to the copy; a failed copy leaves no
member and a retry is clean; an unwind that cannot remove the file keeps its
lineage; the unwind's reference check and unlink run as one section under the
config lock (in-lock callers hand over their locked document); a name sharing another member's slug is refused, the check runs inside
the config lock and concurrent `Triage`/`triage` hires publish exactly one member;
the copy is reserved and written under the config file lock; a dotted template the
listing offers can be hired; a source that vanishes between resolve and copy is 404
with nothing written; a row that fails to persist unwinds the copy; a cancelled
hire finishes its transaction; the source must not be another member's private
copy; an unhireable listing -- uninstalled, disabled, admission-denied, no card,
unmaterialized, unreadable spec, a card path rewritten to leave the app root after
install -- is refused before anything is written; an explicit empty role or
triggers is kept, not replaced by the card's; a link planted at the member
directory fails the hire with nothing written through it; a briefing seed that
fails midway leaves no file behind; a failed template link rolls the hire back,
copy included, and a failed roll-back names the member; unhashable kinds and
non-string text fields are 400; lineage on the roster), `test/test_agents_roster_contract.py` (`named_by_user`,
`template` and `template_version` withheld from the crew manager's roster) and
`MembersPage.identity.test.tsx` (the Source row by display name; the id with no
notice when the app is gone; an `ErrorNotice` when the apps read fails).

## Role update and detach (design step 4)

A member hired from a template can take the template's newer version without
losing what it has become, and can leave the template for good. Both verbs live
in `handlers/members.py` and `member_templates.py`; neither touches lived state
(briefing, rules, activity, the DM thread) or the member's id.

**The plan: `GET /api/members/{member}/role-update`.** Owner-gated; nothing is
written. The three sides are the **pristine copy**
`<data home>/member-templates/<member id>.json` the hire recorded (BASE --
`read_pristine_copy`, pinned read, shape-validated, and it must name THIS member id,
THIS row's private-store generation and the row's own `template` -- a copy written
for a same-id member that was deleted and re-hired, or a same-name file on a
case-insensitive filesystem, is not this member's base -- else 409
`pristine_copy_missing`), the
member's OWN agent file plus its `role` and `triggers` (MINE -- the file is read
through the editor's no-symlink / in-directory fence and must be the copy the
sidecar names as `private_to` this member, else 409 `not_private_copy` -- a binding that is not a string or is outside the agent-name grammar (`kiro_agent: []` in a hand-edited config) is the same 409 from the plan and the apply (detach never reads the binding), never a sidecar lookup on an unhashable key (pinned: `test_a_malformed_binding_is_not_private_copy_not_a_500`): a row
hand-pointed at the app's shared materialized file would otherwise have the update
rewrite a file every member of that template shares), and the template as
MATERIALIZED now -- the `<app>--<agent>` file the bridge writes, the same form the
hire copied and the pristine copy recorded, so the bridge's own servers and managed
refs read as `unchanged`, never as the member's edit (THEIRS -- `resolve_template_ref`
walks the app's cards to the one whose agent declares the row's recorded name and
resolves it with every check the hire runs, so a disabled, uninstalled, tampered or
unmaterialized template answers with the hire's own codes). A member with no `template` is 409 `not_linked`.

`plan_role_update` compares field by field. The fields are the union of the agent
definition's keys on the three sides -- except `name`, which is the member's id on
one side and the template's on the other and nobody's customization -- plus the
card's `role` and `triggers`; a side that lacks a key is `MISSING`, distinct from a
key set to JSON null. Equality is whole-value: a tool list that gained one entry is
one changed field, because a definition is what its author reviewed as a whole.
Each field is `unchanged`, `apply` (only THEIRS changed), `keep` (only MINE
changed), `agree` (both changed to the same value) or `conflict` (both changed
apart -- the user picks). The response carries every field with its three values --
each run, string leaf by string leaf and key by key with shapes preserved, through
the credential / exfiltration-URL redactors before it leaves (`_redact_plan_leaves`:
agent-file fields -- an `mcpServers` env, a URL with a secret in its query, a
prompt -- are hand-editable, agent-writable or a third party's text, and the plan
would otherwise hand a token to the browser verbatim; the fingerprints below are
over the REAL values, so a redacted echo never changes what an apply is checked
against -- pinned: `test_the_plan_echoes_no_credential_from_either_side`) -- and
`update_available` -- true when any field is `apply` or `conflict`, when the
installed version differs from the row's `template_version` (a version-only move
still advances the record), or when the pristine copy's version is behind the
row's (a pristine write that failed after the row advanced: applying is what
rewrites the base, and a stale base would turn the next template change into false
conflicts). It also carries `member_fingerprint`, a digest of MINE as the plan saw
it (the definition plus the row's `role` and `triggers`, canonical JSON, sha256
truncated) and `template_fingerprint`, the same digest of THEIRS (the materialized
definition, the card's role and triggers, the version). Update is offered, never
automatic: nothing in the gateway applies a plan by itself. A stored ref that two
cards' agents both answer to is 409 `template_ambiguous`, never resolved by card
order (the manifest validator refuses such an app at install and re-validation; the
ref is a stored string, so the resolver checks too), and an app's own verdicts --
disabled, admission-denied, an invalid crew section -- surface as themselves from
whichever card raised them, never as `template_not_offered`.

**Applying: `POST /api/members/{member}/role-update`** with
`{"resolutions": {"<field>": "mine" | "theirs"}, "expected_version": "<v>",
"member_fingerprint": "<from the plan>", "template_fingerprint": "<from the plan>"}`.
The plan is re-derived under the app's lifecycle lock (the template cannot move
mid-merge) and the config lock, and drained like a hire. All three anchors are
REQUIRED: an apply is a decision about a plan the user reviewed, and the plan names
the version it was made against, the template body it read and the member it was
made about. `expected_version`
(400 `invalid_expected_version` when absent; without it the route would apply a
THEIRS nobody looked at) must equal the
installed version (409 `template_changed`, naming the version now installed);
`template_fingerprint` (400 `invalid_template_fingerprint` when absent) must equal
the re-derived plan's digest of THEIRS (409 `template_changed` too: the version alone
does not pin the bytes an app materialized under it -- a shipped file rewritten or
re-plumbed under the same version would otherwise merge a body nobody reviewed);
`member_fingerprint` (400 `invalid_member_fingerprint` when absent) must equal the
re-derived plan's digest of MINE (409 `member_changed_since_plan`: a prompt rewritten
in the crew editor or a role renamed between review and apply would otherwise let a
stale `theirs` choice overwrite the newer customization; the panel re-reads the plan
and the user reviews again); every
`conflict` needs a resolution (409 `unresolved_conflicts`,
naming them -- a partial resolution never half-applies; a resolution for a field
not in conflict is ignored, the plan decides what is in conflict). `merge_role_update`
takes THEIRS for `apply` and for a conflict resolved `theirs`, keeps MINE
otherwise, and removes a key the template removed when that applies; the member's
declared `name` is written back unchanged. Everything below happens INSIDE one
`update_config_locked` mutation -- config file lock outer, spec lock inner, the
nesting every other writer of both uses -- and NOTHING is written until every
re-check has passed: (1) the row's binding and private-store generation must be
unchanged (409 `member_changed`) AND its `role` / `triggers` still the card half of
MINE the plan digested (409 `member_changed_since_plan`: a card edit that landed in
another process after the plan is a customization this merge never saw, and the
binding alone would not see it); (2) inside the spec lock, the copy's lineage is
re-checked (409 `not_private_copy`) and the FILE is re-read and re-digested and
must still match `member_fingerprint` (409 `member_changed_since_plan`: the plan
read the file before any lock, and the fork refresh or the agent editor -- every
other writer of it takes this lock -- may have landed in between; a whole-file
write of the older merge would revert their write); only then is the member's
agent file written -- through **`write_member_definition`**, the ONE writer of a
member's own agent file (the merged definition passes
`sanitize_agent_config_governance`, the same whole-config funnel every spec writer
runs before persisting, so a grant governance withholds cannot arrive through a
template; then an atomic replace); the caller owns the locks and the identity
checks, the function owns governance and atomicity, so a later write path for
definition changes (an owner's edit, an agent's self-update) lands through the
same function without restructuring this one -- and the row's `role`, `triggers`
and `template_version` updated in the same document. The file is written AFTER the card check on purpose:
written before it, a stale card's 409 would leave the template's spec on disk over
the member's customization with the row and base still behind it -- the
customization lost and the next plan reporting nothing to re-apply (pinned:
`test_a_card_edit_landing_inside_the_apply_is_not_overwritten`, the member's own
prompt intact after the refusal); (3) the pristine copy advances to the new version (`write_pristine_copy`) AFTER the
row's rename landed and INSIDE the same lock hold (`update_config_locked(after_write=)`):
after, because the base is the row's provenance made concrete -- a rename that fails
must leave the base where the row still is, or the next plan would merge against a
BASE one version ahead of the row and read the template's own edits as the member's;
inside, so a same-id member replaced afterwards (fire + rehire, which take the same
lock) can never receive a late pristine write stamped with the old generation over
its own base -- and detach removes the pristine copy the same way, after its own
commit and inside its hold. The publish is atomic, so a base write that fails after
the commit keeps the PREVIOUS base: the row is one version ahead of it, the next plan
sees MINE equal to THEIRS on every field the template changed and its apply rewrites
the base (logged, `ok` still answered -- the state self-corrects rather than
refusing). The order is what makes a crash recoverable by the next plan: an applied
file beside an un-advanced pristine copy reads as `agree` and re-applies as a no-op,
whereas the reverse order would read the update as the member's own customization
and keep it forever. The response is `{ok, version}` -- the version the member is now on, which
is what the drawer reads; the plan already told the user what applied and what was
kept.

**Detach: `POST /api/members/{member}/detach`.** Clears `template` and
`template_version` on the row (409 `not_linked` when there is nothing to
clear, so a second detach is a refusal, not a second severing) and removes the
pristine copy (`remove_pristine_copy`: an `unlink` on the id-keyed name in
`member-templates/`, after the row's commit landed and inside the same hold, so a
commit that fails keeps a still-linked row's base). The severing runs under the config lock as a read-modify-write that
requires the row to still carry the store generation and the template the request
validated against (409 `member_changed`): a same-id member replaced in between --
deleted and re-hired, or linked to another template -- is somebody else's, and its
provenance and pristine base are not this request's to remove. The agent file, `role`,
`triggers`, the copy's lineage and every piece of lived state stay as they are;
the roster row then reads as a locally created member with a customized copy.
One-way: re-linking is a hire.

Frontend (`pages/members/RoleUpdatePanel.tsx`, under the drawer's Source row for
a member with a `template`): reads the plan; says *Template up to date (vX)*, or
*<App> vY is available (this member is on vX)* with a **Review update** button,
or why the template is unavailable (no base, not its own copy, app gone or
disabled), and always offers **Detach from template** as a two-step inline confirm
that says what stays -- with the cost said BEFORE the click too, in one line under
the button (*Keeps everything; stops following <App>. Cannot be undone.*), so the
reader need not press it to learn whether it can be undone. The review dialog lists
only fields that change or need a decision (`apply`, `keep`, `conflict`;
`unchanged`/`agree` say nothing), shows each side's value, and keeps **Apply vY**
disabled until every conflict has a side chosen (the disabled button's title says
which fields still need one); a `template_changed` or `member_changed_since_plan`
refusal is said in the dialog and the plan re-read, and the picks made against the
old plan are dropped whenever either fingerprint moves -- a `theirs` chosen for the
old prompt is not carried onto the new one. Both mutations refetch the roster and the plan before their pending
state ends. Pinned in `test/test_member_role_update.py` (**the step-4 gate**:
update a template one member customized -- the member's prompt edit and added
tool survive, the template's new hook and triggers apply, the prompt conflict is
resolved the member's way, version and pristine copy advance, briefing untouched,
a second apply is a no-op; a moved template, a template body rewritten under the
same version, two cards answering one ref (`template_ambiguous`; a banned app
surfaces its own verdict), a member edited or renamed since the plan, bad bodies, an unlinked member, an
unavailable template, a missing or foreign pristine copy (another template, another
member, an earlier generation) and a shared binding are refused before anything is
written; a pristine copy behind the row keeps the update offered until an apply
advances it; the pristine path is id-keyed, validated, and distinct for two ids that
share a slug; the bridge's plumbing reads as unchanged and a
re-plumbed materialized file as the template's change; the governance funnel runs on the merged
definition; a conflict resolved the template's way takes theirs; a renamed role is
kept when the card did not move; detach clears provenance and leaves everything
else, and refuses a member replaced under it) and `RoleUpdatePanel.test.tsx`
(current vs available, Apply gated on conflicts and sent with the plan's version
and fingerprint, `template_changed` and `member_changed_since_plan` said in place,
unavailable reasons, two-step detach).

## Selection: the `select_crew` contract

`select_crew` has two modes, both answered as JSON by `_do_select_crew`.

`route_crew` resolves each trigger-matched member independently. Healthy matches
retain their rank and owned store. Matching members whose memory cannot be
resolved appear in `unavailable` with a bounded, path- and credential-redacted
reason. No healthy match and no trigger match are distinct outcomes; unavailable
memory never authorizes substitution with Global memory. A named `select_crew`
refusal returns `crew` and `error` without a bound store or routing activity.

**Roster** (`crew` omitted or empty):

```json
{"default_agent": "default",
 "crews": [{"name": "oncall", "triggers": "incident, prod outage"}],
 "guidance": "Select a crew ONLY when its triggers clearly and specifically match…"}
```

Three rules define that list, and each is load-bearing:

- A crew whose `triggers` is empty or whitespace is **omitted entirely**. There
  is no fallback to `description`: no triggers means not a routing candidate.
- `default_agent` is omitted, because it is the caller.
- The response carries `default_agent` and `guidance` so the model has an
  explicit fallback and a high-confidence bar rather than inferring one.

**Bind** (`crew` names a roster entry):

```json
{"crew": "oncall",
 "bound": {"kiro_agent": "oncall-agent", "workspace": "/…/oncall",
           "memory_store": "oncall-mem", "model": ""}}
```

`crew` is the member's **id** (the `agents` key). A handle that is not a key is
tried once as a **display name** (`member_identity.members_named`, exact after
whitespace normalization): the free-text name that was the key before the id split
minted one from it -- `select_crew("case competition")` in a skill written before the
migration -- still binds, and `bound` reports the id, which is what `spawn_run`
takes. Two members may share a display name, so an ambiguous handle answers
`{"error": "ambiguous crew '…': N members carry that display name — select one by
id: a, b", "available": "…"}` rather than guessing (binding the wrong member's
memory is the worse failure). An unknown name answers
`{"error": "unknown crew '…'", "available": "…"}`. The membership test against
`cfg.agents` is the deny-by-default gate; `SELECT_CREW_SCHEMA` deliberately does
not impose a name grammar, because the display-name fallback needs the raw string
and a stricter schema would list a crew in the roster and then refuse to bind it.

A bind also records a routing-decision pointer through
`members.record_activity` with `via="select_crew"`. Two properties of that write
matter:

- The entry keys the session under `decided_in`, not `session`, because the
  decision is made in the parent session while the crew runs somewhere else. A
  consumer counting sessions a crew took part in therefore cannot miscount a
  session the crew never ran in.
- The caller's memory mode is resolved at the call, and only `persistent`
  sessions are recorded. An unreadable session degrades to the private spelling,
  so the failure mode is a missing entry, never a durably logged private session
  key.

These entries are **intent, not execution**: binding a crew does not oblige the
model to delegate to it, and no `via="spawn"` execution entry exists today.

## Delegating to a bound crew

Explicit member delegation uses `spawn_run(crew=<member>)`. The member alias
resolves its provider template and private memory together. The separate
`agent=` argument identifies a provider template, not a durable member identity;
it must not be used to infer access to a member's private memory.

A private member's own sub-tasks and schedules retain its store. It cannot select
Global V1 or a peer through `spawn_run` or `cron_add`. The trusted owner or Crew
coordinator assigns cross-member work; named tool delegation respects the
recipient's routing opt-in. HTTP spawning verifies the actual calling process
before accepting a parent session, and the run primitive checks the boundary
again before allocating a provider.

A named-but-unknown agent is **refused**, never silently answered by the default
agent, with the machine-readable code `agent_not_found`. That refusal is a
privilege boundary: the default agent frequently runs at broader approval, so a
typo'd or injected name falling back to it would be an escalation at the manager
primitive. An empty `agent` still means "use the default".

Crew Mode resolves the alias itself instead of relying on the coincidence:
`CrewOrchestrator._dispatch_agent` calls `resolve_agent_bindings` per dispatch
and passes `bindings.kiro_agent`. It returns the raw crew name when
`requested_resolved` is `False`, so an unknown crew is refused by
`_validate_agent` rather than quietly running the default agent under a stale
name, and it resolves an empty crew too so the concrete template stays inside
`capabilities.spawn.scopes.agents`.

## Boundaries

- A crew's `triggers` is free text read by a model. It is not a matcher, and no
  regex interprets it.
- `POST /api/agents` requires an explicit `kiro_agent`; the silent `"kirocrew"`
  default is refused, because it made every template-less crew an alias for the
  default agent. A template absent from the installed listing is accepted with a
  warning rather than refused, since an edition may resolve a row the listing
  cannot see.
- A credential-shaped crew name is refused at creation, and roster values are
  masked for every caller but the owner. An already-stored name is not renamed
  retroactively, which is why the owner keeps reading it verbatim: a name must
  be legible to be renamed.
- `kirocrew`, `kirocrew-conductor`, `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` and
  `kirocrew-security-conductor` are in `UNADVERTISED_AGENTS`, so they never
  appear in a rendered roster.

## Tests that pin this

| Test | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `test/test_select_crew.py` | Roster excludes the default crew and every triggerless crew, carries `default_agent` plus guidance; a named crew returns its bindings; an old free-text handle resolves through the display name and binds by id; a display name two members share is refused as ambiguous, naming both ids; an unknown name returns `error` plus `available`; the schema accepts spaces and dots in a crew name |
| `test/test_crew_reasoning_effort.py` | Per-crew effort reaches a crew dispatch |
| `test/test_members.py`, `test/test_members_dm_thread.py` | Slug validation and containment, activity recording and dedupe, DM-binding canonicality, rules and briefing reads |
| `test/test_chat_send_agent_model_default.py` | The crew model default a new session starts on |

## Retired: Crew Mode

Crew Mode was the `"crew"` chat-slot mode: one session whose messages became
durable queue entries, a single-flight decision agent that routed each to a
topic, and one continuable sub-session per topic, with results forwarded back
under `↩ re:` attribution. Its control plane lived in `crew_chat.py`; its
design of record is
[`../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md`](../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md).

It retired in favour of the Crew Members page, which inverts the model: instead
of one nameless session fanning out to topics, each crew is a named member with
its own standing thread. What remains, and why:

- **No ingress.** `"crew"` is in neither `_CREATABLE_MODES` (`chat_handlers`)
  nor `_VALID_MODES` (`chat_folders`) nor the fork override allowlist, so a
  session can no longer be born or switched into it. A caller still sending
  `mode: "crew"` on auto-create gets a plain slot (the value is dropped like any
  unknown mode); on the create and switch endpoints it is `invalid_mode`.
- **Existing sessions come back as plain chat.** `chat_persistence._restored_mode`
  maps a persisted `mode: "crew"` to `""` on both restore paths. The transcript
  is untouched and still renders; nothing is migrated and nothing is deleted.
  The store the mode kept under `<data home>/crew/<folded key>-<digest>/`
  (`queue.json`, `topics.json`, `forwards.json`, `slot_key`) held only routing
  state — it is neither read nor removed, and a reader who wants the disk back
  may delete that directory by hand.
- **Old transcripts keep their shape.** The frontend's `TurnBlock.isCrewReply`
  still honours the persisted `meta.crew_reply` marker so a forwarded topic
  answer in an old session renders outside the collapse pane, as it did when it
  was written. Nothing writes the marker any more.
- **The autonudge crew/member boundary keeps its vocabulary.** `autonudge_authz`
  still lists `"crew"` beside `"member"` in the modes that refuse an outside
  arm. With no slot able to carry the mode the entry is unreachable, and it is
  left in place rather than re-litigating a security boundary in a removal PR.

The sidebar's create-menu entry that used to create a crew-mode session is now
a "Crew Members" door: it opens `/members` when `PREVIEW_CREW` (Settings →
Developer → Feature Previews) is on and lands on that flag's card when it is
off.
