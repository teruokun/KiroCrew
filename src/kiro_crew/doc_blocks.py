"""Structured block extraction for .docx / .pptx OOXML documents.

:mod:`kiro_crew.doc_parser` flattens a document to one plaintext string, which is
what an agent reading an attachment wants. The dashboard's file viewer wants the
structure back, so this module returns a JSON-serializable block list instead.

Hardening is inherited, not re-spelled: the archive-inventory preflight and the
bounded per-entry reader are doc_parser's, imported directly so a change to
either lands here too, and XML parsing goes through the same defusedxml
``fromstring`` (the stdlib parser resolves external entities, an XXE on a
user-supplied document). What this module adds is a bound on what ONE document
can turn INTO -- a block count and an aggregate character budget -- because a
structured payload becomes DOM nodes, so an unbounded block count is a
render-time denial of service and not merely a large response.

Best-effort like doc_parser: on malformed input a function returns whatever it
already has rather than raising, and callers treat an empty list as "no
structured preview available" and fall back to text.
