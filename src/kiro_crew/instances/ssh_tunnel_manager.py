"""Inbound SSH tunnel manager for the Instances feature.

Adapts the supervised-child + state-machine design of
``kiro_crew.tunnel.manager.TunnelManager`` (which points *outward* to expose the
dashboard) to point *inward*: for each connected remote instance it supervises a
local child process that forwards a loopback port to the remote Kiro Crew's
dashboard port, over one of three transports (``Instance.connection_method``):

* ``"ssh"`` (default): ``ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:LP:127.0.0.1:RP <ssh_host>``.
* ``"ssm"``: ``aws ssm start-session --document-name
  AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --target <ssm_target> --parameters
  portNumber=RP,localPortNumber=LP`` — no inbound SSH port or SSH key needed,
  only IAM (``ssm:StartSession``) and the SSM agent on the remote box.
* ``"loopback"``: no child PROCESS. The destination gateway already listens on
  ``127.0.0.1:RP`` on THIS host, so instead of a forwarder child the hub binds
  its own allocated port in-process and relays to that destination, gating each
  connection on the pinned-owner proof — the pane loads from the hub's port, not
  the destination's. This path is admitted only when the process carries the
  exact pod marker and the pod config enables ``instances.allow_loopback_transport``.
  The destination is fixed at ``127.0.0.1`` and no record or config field can
  redirect it.

Design note: a literal ``ssh -fN`` would make ssh fork into the background and
the foreground process exit immediately, which would leave the gateway unable to
supervise or kill the real forwarder. A gateway-supervised child must stay in the
foreground, so we use ``-N`` (no remote command) *without* ``-f``, mirroring how
``TunnelManager`` supervises its own child. Connection multiplexing is pinned
off in the argv (``ControlPath=none``) for the same reason: it lets a user's
``~/.ssh/config`` recreate that fork-and-exit shape from outside this module.
``ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`` ensures
ssh exits if the local forward can't be bound, so a failed connect is detected
rather than hanging. The SSM transport gets the equivalent detection from the
generic ready-poll (:meth:`_Tunnel._wait_until_ready`) plus a post-hoc ownership
recheck, since the ``session-manager-plugin`` child does not expose an
``ExitOnForwardFailure``-style flag.

Scope (Phase 1 / Stage 4): connect, disconnect, status, and shutdown-all, with
port allocation + token mint wired in. The health-probe loop and 2-tier
self-heal are Phase 3 — this module exposes clean seams (an ``on_exit`` hook and
a per-instance state machine) for that follow-up without implementing it here.
SSM support reuses every one of those seams — it is a second *transport* plugged
into the same tunnel/state-machine/self-heal/token-refresh code, not a parallel
implementation. The loopback transport is a third, and the one that shows what
those seams are really keyed on: the readiness wait, the health probe and the
teardown all watch a PORT, so they carry over to a transport with no process at
all. Only the two things that genuinely depend on a child — spawning it
(:meth:`_SshTunnel._spawn_child`) and reading a failure off its exit
(:meth:`_SshTunnel._fail_unhealthy`) — needed a case for it.

**Watching a port is not enough for the loopback transport.** For ssh and ssm the
credential travels into a child, and that child's exit takes the forwarded socket
with it: there is no window in which the port answers but the peer is somebody
else. The loopback transport's destination is an ordinary port on this host, so
if the gateway exits, any local process may bind the freed port and answer every
later TCP probe — which would leave the tunnel CONNECTED and hand it a reusable
~20h bearer. So the loopback transport carries an IDENTITY as well as a port: the
proven owner pid (:func:`_proven_loopback_owner`, over the address-scoped
:func:`kiro_crew.port_resolution.port_is_gateway_owned_on_loopback`) is pinned at
establishment by the readiness wait, re-proved by every health-probe cycle, and
COMPARED rather than re-adopted. A proof failure or a changed pid condemns the
tunnel one-way: sends are refused immediately and the tunnel fails toward a fresh
``connect``, never rebinding onto the new listener.

Two send classes, two freshness levels. The rare credential-ESTABLISHING send
(:meth:`SshTunnelManager.token_validates`) proves immediately before it, so the
bearer the browser receives is confirmed against a listener checked at that
moment. The per-request proxy / transfer / search path reads the verdict the last
probe established (:meth:`_SshTunnel.loopback_ownership_ok`), because an ``lsof``
per proxied request is not a latency this path can pay. The accepted residual is
therefore one probe interval wide: a listener replaced just after a passing probe
is refused only once the next probe runs. It is bounded by the probe interval
(``constants.DEFAULT_PROBE_INTERVAL_SECS``) and by the condemnation being
synchronous — the
verdict flips the moment a proof fails, before the state machine has finished
tearing the tunnel down — and no send after that point is admitted.

**The pane's own connections are gated on the SOCKET, not on the port.** The
browser reaches the destination through an in-process forward
(:meth:`_SshTunnel._forward_pane_connection`) carrying a query token and a
host-scoped cookie of its own, and it is the one path a port-scoped proof cannot
gate: proving a port and then dialling it are two steps, and a local process
retry-looping the bind eventually wins that gap. So the relay dials FIRST and then
attributes the process holding the far end of THAT established connection
(:func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.established_peer_pids`, matched on the exact
4-tuple), and carries bytes only when it is the pinned owner. An answer naming
another pid refuses and condemns the tunnel; no answer refuses that connection
alone — an empty attribution is also what an already-closed connection looks
like — except where the destination is this process's own port and there is no
second party to attribute. Every ownership lookup is bounded, so no wedged tool
holds a browser connection — or a teardown — open.

Security (standard practices): loopback-bound forwards only (never ``0.0.0.0``);
child spawned via argv list (no local shell) for both transports; ``ssh_host`` /
``remote_bin`` (SSH) and ``ssm_target`` / ``aws_profile`` / ``aws_region`` (SSM)
injection-validated before use; minted tokens held in memory only and never
logged.

    Identity is pid + start time + exact argv, checked in that order, and the

    DEAD gateway's process group, where a group signal could hit unrelated
    survivors — so it gets a pid-scoped signal only, which suffices because
    ``ssh -N`` holds the forward itself and spawns no descendants of its own.

        A SIGKILLed gateway never runs teardown, so its forwarder child
        survives, reparented to init with nothing left to reap it: one idle
        process, one loopback port, and one live session to the remote per
        hard-kill → reconnect cycle. The restarted manager finds the recorded
        ``local_port`` occupied and (correctly) allocates around it; this hook
        is what turns that permanent leak into a reclaim.

        Reclamation is keyed on OUR OWN recorded identity, never a
        process-table match — matching the table by argv pattern would
        SIGTERM forwards operators opened themselves, and no
        pattern can distinguish our child from a stranger's. The registry
        itself is agent-writable, so a recorded claim is honored only when it
        AUTHENTICATES: the record must carry the gateway's own MAC over
        (instance id, pid, start time, port), computed at spawn under a key
        derived from the SEL trust root — which an agent can neither read nor
        replace — so a record written or re-pointed by anything but this
        gateway fails verification outright. Behind the MAC, defense in depth
        from kernel-owned facts: the candidate must be a genuine ORPHAN — not
        a pid this manager currently supervises, and reparented to init
        (``get_ppid == 1``), which no live gateway's forwarder is. Then the
        recorded pid is trusted only behind a STRICT identity check, both
        halves recorded at spawn: the pid's start time must equal the recorded
        ``forwarder_start``, AND its full argv must exactly equal the forward
        command line this manager would construct for the recorded port (host
        and all). Anything less — either hint missing, process gone,
        attributes unreadable, or any element differing — means the identity
        cannot be confirmed: the process is left alone and connect falls
        through to normal allocation. The start-time half is what defeats pid
        recycling (argv can collide in principle; a recycled pid's start time
        cannot), and it is re-verified before the SIGKILL escalation inside
        the worker. Best-effort: a failed reclaim never fails the connect, it
        only leaves the leak for the next attempt.

        A rebuilt-vs-recorded argv can also drift apart without any foul play
        (an edited compression/host setting, or an ``aws`` entrypoint the
        kernel rewrites through a shebang) — that misses the reclaim, never
        mis-kills, and is logged below so the miss is visible instead of
        silent.

        Runs under the manager lock (its caller ``connect`` holds it); every
        blocking step — the port probe and the verify-and-signal worker — is

        validation / mint / spawn error via the returned status (state ERROR).
        Works for either ``connection_method`` — the transport is resolved by
        :meth:`_resolve_transport`.

        ``rebuild=True`` breaks the idempotence on purpose: a CONNECTED tunnel is
        torn down first (``keep_intent`` — the user is asking for the crew, not
        turning it off) and a fresh forwarder is spawned on a DIFFERENT local
        port: the port just freed is excluded from the allocation, so both a
        stalled stream on the old forwarder and a cause bound to the old port
        itself are escaped by one Retry. This is the pane's Retry after a load watchdog
        fired on a document that DID navigate: the transport is up by every
        probe the manager runs (``/api/health`` answers, the credential
        validates), yet one stream inside it stalled and the pane's module
        graph will wait on it forever. Nothing short of a new TCP path clears
        that, and the plain connect — which sees CONNECTED and returns — would
        hand the same stalled tunnel back.

        A teardown that fails (the stop raises) is reported as an ERROR status,
        the same way every other connect failure is: the live tunnel is left
        exactly as :meth:`_teardown_locked` leaves it (intact — nothing is
        removed unless the stop succeeded), the reason is retained for
        :meth:`last_error`, and the caller gets a 502 with a message instead of
        a propagated exception turned into an unexplained 500.

        ``only_if_connected=True`` is the opposite restriction: answer a
        CONNECTED tunnel exactly like the plain connect (its status, its cached
        token) but, when the tunnel is not up, spawn nothing and touch nothing
        -- return a DISCONNECTED status and leave ``was_connected`` as the user
        last set it. This is the viewport's auto-warm, whose job is to pre-mount
        panes for tunnels that are ALREADY up, never to bring one up. The check
        runs under the manager lock, the same lock :meth:`disconnect` holds
        while it stops a tunnel, so an auto-warm racing a disconnect either sees
        the tunnel still CONNECTED (and warms a pane the disconnect's
        ``removeWarm`` then drops) or sees it gone and stands down; it can never
        re-open a tunnel the user just closed, which a probe-then-connect from
        the browser could.

        A rebuild replaced the tunnel child, so the recorded forwarder
        identity (``forwarder_pid`` + ``forwarder_start`` + the
        ``local_port`` that child is bound to) must move with
        ``was_connected`` — a stale identity would point a later hard-kill
        reclaim at a process that does not exist (harmless, the identity
        check refuses it) while the ACTUAL replacement child leaked
        unrecorded. All hints go in one write.

        ``local_port`` belongs in that set for two reasons, and this write
        carries the same fields as :meth:`connect`'s so the pair cannot drift
        apart. A rebuild takes its port from the LIVE tunnel (see
        :meth:`_recover`), which may differ from the recorded one. And
        ``forwarder_sig`` is a MAC over the port, so recording a pid against
        a different port than the one it was signed with leaves the signature
        failing verification — the reclaim then refuses the very child this
        write exists to record, and every consumer reading the recorded port
        (the pane URL, :meth:`diagnose`'s fallback) addresses a port nothing
        is listening on.

        The persist stays INSIDE the manager lock so write order equals
        lock-acquisition order: a concurrent :meth:`disconnect`'s
        ``was_connected=False`` (also written under the lock) can never be
        overwritten by this recovery write landing late. The tracked-check
        gates the persist — an instance the user disconnected must not be
        re-marked auto-reconnectable. ``_persist_hint`` keeps the lock held
        until the worker write completes even under cancellation; a cancelled
        bare ``to_thread`` await would NOT stop the already-running thread, so
        its write could land after the lock released and break the ordering.
